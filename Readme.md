## Domain Description
We will continue working on the Streaming Service topic we developed in _Lab #1_ and _Lab #2_.
Nonetheless, most domain is already implemented for you and you will focus on the use and implementation of BST.

Also, we will learn how to partially match strings using regular expressions. 
Here is a link with [documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/regex_match).
